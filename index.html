    My name is Jeff.
    I went to Concord-Carlisle High School, and then Brown University, and now I live in Manhattan.
    <br><br>
    My parents spend half their time in Concord, and the other half in Boston.
    I usually just follow them around on the holidays.
    I also have a sister in medical school - she's three years older, and married.
    <br><br>
    My two main hobbies growing up were cello and soccer. I still do both of these.
    <br><br>
    I'll add more things here as they happen.
